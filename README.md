## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:
- **Docker** (for containerization)
- **Docker Compose** (to run multi-container applications)
- **Node.js** (for the frontend build tools)
- **Python 3.x** (for backend development)
- **PostgreSQL** (for the database)

---

## Development Setup

To run the Shopwise application in your local development environment, we recommend using **Docker** for ease of setup and isolation of dependencies.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shopwise.git
cd shopwise
```

### 2. Docker Setup

This application uses Docker and Docker Compose to containerize both the frontend and backend services.

#### Running the Application with Docker

1. **Build and Start Docker Containers:**

   From the root of the project, run the following command to build and start the services defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will:
   - Build the Docker images for the frontend and backend.
   - Set up the PostgreSQL database container.
   - Start the containers in the background.

2. **Access the Application:**
   - The frontend will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
   - The backend API will be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

#### Running Docker Containers in Detached Mode

If you prefer to run the containers in detached mode (in the background), use:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Database Migrations

Once the containers are running, you'll need to run Django migrations to set up the database schema.

```bash
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
```

This will apply any necessary database migrations.

---

### Running Tests

You can run tests for both the frontend and backend services.

#### Backend Tests (Django)

To run backend tests using Django's test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py test
```

#### Frontend Tests (React)

To run the React app's tests, execute:

```bash
docker-compose exec frontend npm test
```

This will run all the tests for the React components and display the results in the terminal.
